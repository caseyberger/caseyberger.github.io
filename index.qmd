## Equity in STEM 

Academia in general and STEM fields in particular have a long way to go towards creating a welcoming environment where women, LGBTQ folks, BIPOC, and other underrepresented groups can thrive. We all have a responsibility to listen, learn, and be part of the solution.

## Professional Development Resources

Our education -- especially those of us in STEM -- focuses on content and skill building in a narrow, deep area of interest. Rarely are we explicitly taught the so-called "soft skills" of communication and teamwork and problem solving and creative thinking, let alone the "life management" skills of time tracking, prioritization, and finding room for rest and recovery.

I've assembled here a set of tools and resources for effective work and a reflective life.
