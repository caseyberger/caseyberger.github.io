## Accessing Compute Resources and Reporting Issues
You can access the Smith JupyterHub server [here](https://jupyterhub.smith.edu/). You will need to log in with your Smith credentials. If you are off-campus, you will have to log into a VPN to get access. \

Instructions on how to install the Pulse Secure VPN can be found [on the Smith website] (https://www.smith.edu/its/tara/networking/vpn.html). You need to log in to the VPN with your Smith credentials before accessing JupyterHub. Once you've signed in (and done the Duo push), you should be able to access the server as normal.\
